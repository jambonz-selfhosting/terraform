# GCP Image Mappings for jambonz Terraform deployments
# Uses image families - generate-tf.sh resolves to latest image in each family
#
# Image families are assigned by Packer based on variant:
#   variant "fs"             -> family "jambonz-fs"
#   variant "sip-rtp"        -> family "jambonz-sip-rtp"
#   variant "web-monitoring" -> family "jambonz-web-monitoring"
#   etc.
